Start simple™

Super simple starter kit for web stuff ✨


Note: This is my personal "getting started" package for things I build on the web. Covers basically what you need to get something going– an experiment, prototype, a single page site, or the beginnings of something grand. I hope you find this useful! Enjoy.

## Features
- Basic setup to get you started!
- No frills
- Runs on gulp (npm is too npm for my taste)
- Compiles stylus, twig
- Compresses images
- Clean and easy media queries via Rupture
- Autoprefix, because yolo
- ES6 support
- Live reload
- Module up with Webpack
- Cute log messages with emojis (lol)
